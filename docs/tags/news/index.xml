      <description>Some of you may know that there is a War Memorial in the church of St St Mary&amp;rsquo;s and St Michael&amp;rsquo;s in Burleydam. This commemorates the members of the parish who were killed in the conflict. The memorial was erected in 1920 and is made from sandstone. In recent years the engravings of the names of the fallen have started to become indistinct.
We have been lucky to obtain donations from Burleydam Village Hall Trust, Combermere Abbey and a Communities Grant from Cheshire East to re-cut the names.</description>
