      <description>The Fingerpost renovations at Wilkesley and Goldsmiths are now complete. David Gosling has done a magnificent job with the restoration which took several months. He had to make some new fingers to replace the missing ones and spent a long time cleaning and repainting the old ones.

The Wilkesley fingerpost was made by WH Smith in Whitchurch (not the news agent), the maker of the Goldsmith fingerpost in unknown.</description>

      <description>Work has almost been completed on restoring the finger post signs at Goldsmiths and Wilkesley. The Parish Council is hoping to be able to restore the sign on the island outside Fields View. In addition we hope to be able to convert the grass triangle into some sort of hard standing, which will make it safer for children waiting for the school bus.</description>

      <description>I have moved the web site so that it is now hosted on Github.com. I have also changed the site generator from Pelican to Nikola.
I&amp;rsquo;ll put up another post later to explain why I have made these changes. Meanwhile you may notice a few minor glitches in this site, while I iron out all the little bugs caused by the changes.
The new site should well on both mobile devices and computers.</description>

      <description>Some of you may know that there is a War Memorial in the church of St St Mary&amp;rsquo;s and St Michael&amp;rsquo;s in Burleydam. This commemorates the members of the parish who were killed in the conflict. The memorial was erected in 1920 and is made from sandstone. In recent years the engravings of the names of the fallen have started to become indistinct.
We have been lucky to obtain donations from Burleydam Village Hall Trust, Combermere Abbey and a Communities Grant from Cheshire East to re-cut the names.</description>
