If you would like something published on the site, please send your
contribution to editor@dodcott.org. Time constraints mean that I can
only accept submissions by email in plain text.

I am happy to include items publicising an event, or a local
business. If you want to include a picture, please email me in advance
so we can discuss the best method of sending the picture. My email
will automatically discard messages that contain large attachments.

If you think that you, your children, or your school would like to
help build the site, some very basic instructions are to be found in
"Running the Site on Your Own Computer" in the README.org file on
Github. If you need more detailed help, please contact me at
ian@manor-farm.org. I am happy to help getting you started.

The complete source of the whole site is always available from [GitHub](https://github.com/dodcott/dodcott-cum-wilkesley)
