Today was the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of hostilities that
began the Great War. A short ceremony was held at the War Memorial at
St Mary's and St Michael's Church at Burleydam. It was a warm sunny
morning and about 30 people attended. During the ceremony the names of
the soldiers from the Parish who lost their lives was read out.
