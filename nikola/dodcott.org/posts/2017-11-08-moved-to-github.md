I have moved the web site so that it is now hosted on Github.com. I have also
changed the site generator from [Pelican](https://pelican.readthedocs.io/en/3.0/) to [Nikola](https://getnikola.com/).

I'll put up another post later to explain why I have made these
changes. Meanwhile you may notice a few minor glitches in this site, while I iron out
all the little bugs caused by the changes.

The new site should well on both mobile devices and computers.
